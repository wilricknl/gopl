# Exercise 1.3

Experiment to measure the difference in running time between our 
potentially inefficient versions and the one that uses strings.Join. 
(Section 1.6 illustrates part of the time package, and Section 11.4 shows
how to write benchmark tests for systematic performance evaluation.)

# Notes

* Run this test with `go test -bench=.`
* Test file names must end with `_test.go`
* In order to run tests a main module is required, which can be created
  with `go mod init`
